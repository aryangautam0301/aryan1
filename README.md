Global-Temperature-Change-Prediction
A Data Science project that uses an ARIMA model for Time Series Forecasting, to predict the temperature of any given city across a specific time period.

The project also involves an analysis of the impact of increasing pollution levels and Greenhouse Gases on temperature change, and predicts the top-10 cities in the US that will witness the maximum temperature change in the next 10 years.
